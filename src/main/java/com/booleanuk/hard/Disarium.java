 * A number is said to be Disarium if the sum of its digits raised to their respective positions is the number itself.
 * Given a number, return a boolean to determine if it is Disarium.
 * E.g.
 * solution(75) -> false because 7^1 + 5^2 = 7 + 25 = 32
 * solution(135) âžž true because 1^1 + 3^2 + 5^3 = 1 + 9 + 125 = 135
